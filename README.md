This is a little personnal project

It is supposed to be a turn per turn strategy game taking place in the terminal of the code editor because i don t know how to visualise it otherwise

It has become an introduction to pathfinding 


Note to keep in mind when reading the code :
    either i am really autistic or my question mark formulas do not work properly so expect to see a lot of if/else statements when reading my code

#### __TODO__
 PLEASE DO A CHAINED LIST FOR THE PTHFINDING THING
 --> next = pathfinding(objective_tile, current_tile, \_wtv_)
    --> not necessary


working on noise value to make terrain
    -- done

working on Astar algo but hoping to get myself to work on the c++ visual engine


Might be interesting to do some research on waypoint pathfinding
    --> search for points where the algo is forced to go and name them "waypoints"
    --> calculate the weight of the paths, might be float, dijkstra, ez
